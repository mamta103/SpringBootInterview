2.What is the difference between SIT and UAT?

SIT->System Intregration Testing
UAT->USer Acceptence Testing
both above belongs to functional testing.System Integration Testing (SIT) ensures that individual modules, product set-ups, batch operations, basic reporting functionalities and key interfaces of an application-under-test (AUT) work well.

3.AD Environment:: Active Directy

4.A GAP:: GAP analysis is a method of assessing the differences in performance between a business' information systems or software applications to determine whether business requirements are being met and, if not, what steps should be taken to ensure they are met successfully.

Gap refers to the space between "where we are" (the present state) and "where we want to be" (the target state). A gap analysis may also be referred to as a needs analysis, needs assessment or need-gap analysis. 

5.SSO is a solution that allows one sign on, obviously. For example, I've had (many years)of experience using ClearTrust in conjunction with RSA Secur-Id as a very secure SSO solution.

Single sign-on (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials (e.g., name and password) to access multiple applications. ... On the back end, SSO is helpful for logging user activities as well as monitoring user accounts

ClearTrust (now called RSA Access Manager) is a SSO solution that works very well with web apps, since it's a web-based solution, and it supports multiple types of authentication (AD, userid/password, SecurId, certificates) and also works with about any OS or web server you can think of.

6.Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) is a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution created by Microsoft. As a component of Windows Server operating systems, it provides users with authenticated access to applications that are not capable of using Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) through Active Directory (AD).

7.GTI:: Industry Standard

8.What is the Big Difference Between SAML and OAuth? ... SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an umbrella standard that encompasses profiles, bindings and constructs to achieve Single Sign On (SSO), Federation and Identity Management. OAuth (Open Authorization) is a standard for authorization of resources.


9.What is <scope> under <dependency> in pom.xml for?
The <scope> element can take 6 values: compile, provided, runtime, test, system and import.

This scope is used to limit the transitivity of a dependency, and also to affect the classpath used for various build tasks.

compile

This is the default scope, used if none is specified. Compile dependencies are available in all classpaths of a project. Furthermore, those dependencies are propagated to dependent projects.

provided

This is much like compile, but indicates you expect the JDK or a container to provide the dependency at runtime. For example, when building a web application for the Java Enterprise Edition, you would set the dependency on the Servlet API and related Java EE APIs to scope provided because the web container provides those classes. This scope is only available on the compilation and test classpath, and is not transitive.

runtime

This scope indicates that the dependency is not required for compilation, but is for execution. It is in the runtime and test classpaths, but not the compile classpath.

test

This scope indicates that the dependency is not required for normal use of the application, and is only available for the test compilation and execution phases.

system

This scope is similar to provided except that you have to provide the JAR which contains it explicitly. The artifact is always available and is not looked up in a repository.

import (only available in Maven 2.0.9 or later)

This scope is only used on a dependency of type pom in the section. It indicates that the specified POM should be replaced with the dependencies in that POM's section. Since they are replaced, dependencies with a scope of import do not actually participate in limiting the transitivity of a dependency.

10.SAML SSO works by transferring the user's identity from one place (the identity provider) to another (the service provider). This is done through an exchange of digitally signed XML documents. Consider the following scenario: A user is logged into a system that acts as an identity provider.
